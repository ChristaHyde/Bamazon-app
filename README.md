1. My Bamazon app prompts the user with two messages.

   * The first asks them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.

2. Once the customer has placed the order, your application then checks if the store has          enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If there is not enough product, the app logs a phrase `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevents the order from going through.

3. However, if my bamazon store does have enough of the product, it will fulfill the              customer's order.
   * This means it updates the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
   * Once the update goes through, the customer then sees the total cost of their purchase.
